# Nolporas
A project to support different natural language processing tasks with corpora. This repository will serve as a mean to share different corpora, mainly for research purposes.

## The naming
The naming is taken from the word Corpora:
- First I named it **Korpoari**, K (karim) and ari (Aries). But, I thought may be I must look for a more generic name, in case someone else want to contribute with his/her corpus.
- Since the repository is destined for NLP testing/training benchemarks, I wanted to incorporate the characters "N, L, P" into the name. So I came up with the name **Nolpora** (then I found it is an indian name). 
- Corpora is the plurial of Corpus, so Nolpora is the plural of Nolpus. But, adding an "s" at the end will show it better and gives a unique name which is **Nolporas**
